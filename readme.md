Backend on ASP.NET

This demo contains a web-app with an architecture on separation of concerns and clean code.

The connected data source is provided by a third part API service.

## Installation

- Download ASP.NET on your computer: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download]()

- Get an API key or ask for one at: [https://www.funda.nl/voormakelaars/verdieping/trends/]() 

- Clone the repo and move to it with your CLI

- run: `dotnet user-secrets set "FundaApiKey" "<your-api-key>"`

- run: `dotnet run`

- Open your browser on [http://localhost:5000/]()

## Note

Due to API rate usage restriction the data consumption is moderately limited.
